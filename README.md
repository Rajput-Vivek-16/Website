# Website using Flask 
Welcome to my first Git Repository! I'm Rajput Vivek (23110269), and I've created a project utilizing Flask to build a web application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:
<br>
<br>
# First convert both PDFs to CSVs by using the Fitz library

db1_political.pdf to politics.csv and db_2 purchaser.pdf to purchaser.csv by using the code which is given in pdf_to_csv.py file.

# Importing CSVs into MySQL 
Before we begin, we need to convert two PDFs into CSV format using the Fitz library. Run the provided code in pdf_to_csv.py to convert:
* db1_political.pdf to politics.csv
* db_2 purchaser.pdf to purchaser.csv

<br>
We will use MySQL Workbench to create schema named vivek.

<br>
In this schema, we will import both CSVs in two different tables. Here I am showing how to import CSV in the table of Schema vivek.

# Switch to VsCode

Now, let's switch to VsCode. Create a new folder containing:
<br>
A folder named templates which includes:
<br>
index.html
<br>
Other necessary files such as main.py.
